# PUT-Hand-MechanicalDesign

## About

PUT-Hand is an open-source project of a 5-finger anhomomorphic gripper. PUT-Hand is designed to manipulate wide range of object including elastic objects. PUT-Hand was designed using as many off-the-shelf parts and FDM 3D printing technology, with single elements requiring aluminium CNC machining or stainless steel turning. The [PUT-Hand repositories](https://github.com/puthand) include all parts necessary to recreate the proposed design: mechanical files, PCB design and firmware.

PUT-Hand-MechanicalDesign repository contains all detailed mechanical design files for PUT-Hand anhomomorphic gripper project, together with proper assembly files. Files can be opened using Autodesk Inventor software, minimum required version: 2017. Main assembly file: [./PUT-Hand.iam](./PUT-Hand.iam)
